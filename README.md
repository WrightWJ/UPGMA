# UPGMA

I implemented the UPGMA algorithm using Python.

This algorithm is fast and relatively efficient. It is wrong due to the assumpsion there is a constant biological clock.

Feel free to use this implementation. The msa.txt is required. It is a MUSCLE aligned sequence of the 5.8S ribosomal rRNA between many different organisms. The overall goal of the project was to determine where Fir trees came from.

I'll leave that up to you to see, if you want to look at the results.
